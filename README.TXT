CARRIER OPS:

See the FlightGear documents, or wiki, for information on how to start the simulation on a carrier.  When the simulation starts you should be in position at the catapult, with the parking brakes already set, engines running, and canopy open.  Hit the "L" key to engage the launchbar and extend nose gear strut. A green light on the instrument panel is on when the launch bar is engaged.  Set your throttle to max and hit the "Shift-C" key to launch.  Once airborne you can clean up by raising gear ("G" (lower case G) key), raising flaps ("]" key), and closing canopy ("c" (lower case C) key).

To prepare to land, first check that your fuel load is not too high.  Now lower the hook ("n" (lower case n key)).  A green light on the instrument panel illuminates when the hook is down.  Configure with gear down ("shift-G"), full flaps ("]]"), and canopy open ("c").  Plan on a final approach speed of 130-140 knots, unless you are too heavy, in which case you need to add speed.  Line up with the angled deck and look for the white light on the "ball" for glidepath information.  Plan to touch down just prior to the first wire.  Raise the hook ("n" (lower case n) key) when you come to a stop.  If you miss the wires then apply full power and go around for another try.  Watch your fuel state!


REFUELING:

Click on the "REFUEL" switch. A green light will illuminate on the fuel guage when onloading fuel.


FUEL DUMP:

The fuel "DUMP" switch will cause fuel to be dumped at 1500 pounds per minute.  There is a standpipe which will stop the dump at 800 pounds remaining.


THE MODEL:

The model is made by Alpha Simulations (http://www.alphasim.co.uk/) and was done in Microsoft's native format (MDL) for use with MSFS.  It was released by them as "freeware, non-commercial", so don't sell this model.  I converted it to AC3D format for use in FlightGear.  I added a 3D cockpit, refuel probe, and some more hook parts, gear parts, exterior lights, animations, submodels, systems, and flight dynamics..
