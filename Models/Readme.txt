Below you'll find the original copyright information for this model.  

To adapt this model for use in FlightGear I have converted it from MDL to AC3D format
using the threedconvert utility provided by FlightGear.  The BMP were converted to RGB
(also known as SGI) format using The GIMP.  After the mesh is converted to AC3D format 
the surfaces are all individual objects, so they need to be regrouped into a few 
objects and named.  Textures are remapped where needed. Animations were added in XML.  
I added the refueling probe.  A 3D cockpit was added, using instruments from
the "DavePack" collection of instruments, as well as several improvements.
